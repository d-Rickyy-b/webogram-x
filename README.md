# webogram-x
Dark theme (css) for the [old, angular based Telegram web app](https://github.com/zhukov/webogram), with colors from other "Telegram X" apps.

## Project status
On [2021-04-15 Telegram released their new, more modern web app](https://t.me/tgbeta/4346) that's now available at the same url as the old web app. The new apps got a dark theme out of the box, hence this custom theme is no longer maintained.

### Showcase
Here is a picture to get an idea of how the style will look like.

### Usage
To use this style, you need a browser plugin such as [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/). It injects custom CSS code into specified webpages.

Now either copy & paste the content of the [webogram-x.user.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d-Rickyy-b/webogram-x/master/webogram-x.user.css) (or the minified version) into the plugin you are using.

Or ðŸ“¦ [install the usercss](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d-Rickyy-b/webogram-x/master/webogram-x.user.css) automatically. Also supports automatic future updates.

### Found an issue
If you think you found an issue with the style (and I bet there are plenty), go ahead and open an issue in the GitHub issue tracker.
Thanks for your support.
